    content:
      "As a brand, you're not just talking to customers, you're talking to people. It is imperative to get the tone of language used just right to bring across the correct personality of the brand. Copy tone can be the difference between connecting with your potential consumer or not. And this, in turn, affects a potential sale. Coronation's copy tone finds the sweet spot where confidence, drive and resourcefulness meet. However, it never sounds unapproachable. The tone embodies an esteem that reassures financial experts but also a personality that doesn't look down on those that aren't at that financial level yet. This builds trust across the consumer spectrum and assures people that they are indeed partners with Coronation in their financial journey. There are different segments within the Coronation customer base. Sometimes we'll be talking to people who are incredibly wealthy. These people have made their money and want to begin or continue their journey with Coronation. When talking to these people, we use language that makes the consumer feel like they are “one of us”. The language is less explanatory because these people are au fait with monetary concepts. There's an acknowledgment of the person's achievements and success. Other times, we'll be talking to someone closer to starting out: the person who maybe doesn't have as much money as those who are established but has enough to fulfill potential. In no way is our tone condescending. Instead, we take a respectful, warm tone, acknowledging their money's potential and their wisdom in wanting to see it grow. In general, when it comes to word choice, Coronation doesn't use language so casual that it misrepresents the company's expertise. But neither do we use words that are lofty or cold - the other extreme of the tonality spectrum. This applies across both consumer segments described above. At the end of the day, when people read any communication, they must finish with a strong sense that what's important to them is important to Coronation. NB: Our tone of voice does not apply to legal information or legal disclaimers. Copy Tone Example. Coronation's copy tone is one that perfectly balances professionalism and approachability. It speaks finance in a way that is relatable and in language that is understood by all customers, without ever losing the premium nature of the brand. The tone also steers clear of long-winded sentences to make the writing easier to read and digest.",
